    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

SGDC is very quick to train but the scores are also lower compared to the other models across training and testing. \n",

    "**Answer: ** AdaBoost is a popular boosting algorithm that aims to combine several weak learners to produce a strong learner. Let me try to explain the intuition behind AdaBoost. In a nutshell, AdaBoost uses a sequence of weak learners to train the data. Each weak learner focuses on a particular aspect of the data, which should give a better prediction than random guessing. We then obtain a strong learner by assigning different important values (weights) to the weak learners and taking their votes, which gives a final decision. Here for our algorithm, each weak learner will be a decision tree with one node. A decision tree with one node partition the data into two parts by asking a question regarding a particular feature. For example, for our census data, a decision tree with one node can ask if the age of a person is more than 40. It then classify the income as >50k if the age is more than 40, and <=50k if the age is <=40. This is certainly a very crude way to classify the income, but it is certainly better than random guessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now to explain how the weak learners are combined, let's look at a simplified example we want to classify the data as positive or negative using three decision trees (weak learners).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"AdaBoost.png\", width = 450>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Box 1: ** We see that the first learner split the data into two parts: the blue part is positive and the red part is negative. There are three misclassification, namely the three pluses in the negative part. We are going to assign higher weights to the three pluses before sending the data to the second learner. We can also assign a weight to the first learner based on the misclassification. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Box1.png\", width = 220>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Box 2: ** Now we fit the second learner on the modified data from the first learner (notice how the pluses are bigger). Again the second learner will split the data into two parts. This time three minuses are misclassified. So we are going to assign higher weights to the three minuses before passing the data to the third learner. Again we can also assign a weight to the second learner based on the misclassification. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Box2.png\", width = 220>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Box 3: ** Next we fit the third learner on the modified data from the second learner (notice how the three pluses and the three minuses are bigger compared to the other points). We stop here since we have only three learners. Again a weight for the third learner can be computed from the misclassification. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Box3.png\", width = 250>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Box 4: ** Finally we impose the three boxes on one another to obtain a final model (we add the weights of all the learners to split the data into positive region and negative region). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Box4.png\", width = 250>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then given a new test point, we can determine whether it is positive or negative based on which region it belongs to. For our census data, we want to partition the data into positive (making more than 50k) and negative (making <= 50k) regions. We can have a collection of weak learners each working on a particular aspect of the data. For instance we can have a decision tree that works on the age feature, a decision tree that works on the capital_gain feature etc. Each decision tree will then be given a weight depending on how well it classify the data. Given an individual, we then look at the weighted votes of all the decision trees to determine whether that person belongs to the positive region (making >50k) or the negative region (making <=50k), and that is how our algorithm works. \n",

    "   First of all we observe that these are all the numerical features in the data. The features age, hours-per-week, education-num agree with our answer, although the algorithm put education-num behind hours-per-week. In retrospect I think it makes sense, because a higher education does not always guarantee good jobs and if you work a part-time job, it is hard to earn more than 50K. What is surprising is the importance of capital-gain and capital-loss. My guess is that investment is a strong indicator of how much people make. People with higher income tend to invest more and have higher capital-gain. Moreover, the distributions of capital-gain and capital-loss are very skew, with most of them zeros. So I think the non-zero entries can give a strong indication of whether an individual makes more or less than 50K.        "

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

The testing set has around 9000 individual, so we misclassify at most 500. However going from the full data to the reduced data, the total time decreases about 59%. This is a significant speedup. So if training time is a factor, and if misclassification is not so detrimental to the business, I would consider using the reduced data. "
